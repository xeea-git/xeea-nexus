# Contributing to XEEA SECURITY Projects

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the XEEA SECURITY arsenal. It's people like you that make the shadows a little bit darker.

### 📜 PURE XEEA Standard
All projects in this repository adhere to the **PURE XEEA** standard:
1.  **Language**: All documentation, code comments, and interfaces must be in high-quality English.
2.  **Branding**: Do not include external tool names, credits, or marketing references within the core logic or help menus.
3.  **Efficiency**: We prioritize "minimalist, automated, and effective" code. If a task can be done in 10 lines of clean Python/Impacket logic, don't use 100 lines of wrapper.

### 🛠 How Can I Contribute?
-   **Intelligence Gathering**: Provide research on new AD CS primitives or coercion vectors.
-   **Security Hardening**: Improve the evasion capabilities of our stagers and RPC handlers.
-   **Bug Reports**: If something doesn't "handshake" properly, let us know via an issue.
